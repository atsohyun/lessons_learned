The Future of HCI

This is a summary of Irene Au's TED Talk in March 2018. <br> Source: https://www.ted.com/talks/the_future_of_human_computer_interaction

### The Beginning of HCI
We key in the data, and computers are used to process the data.
- Invention: Vacuum tubes, Early computers
- Language: Physical switches
- HCI Goal: Get the data processed

### Moving on
PCs were born. Interactions began. Humans would like to see the data represented in a digital space.
- Invention: Transistor + Integrated circuits + Microprocessors = Personal Computers
- Language: Command-line Interface
- HCI Goal: Bring the physical world into a digital space

### The HCI Revolution
Douglas Engelbart's invention of the mouse gave birth to the field of HCI.
WIMP interfaces became ubiquitous. Macintosh symbolized the perfect GUI.
- Invention: Computer mouse + GUI
- Language: Direct manipulation
- HCI Goal: Mimic the physical world and make it user-friendly

### iPod, iPad, iPhones
Language has evolved to meet the variety of computing devices.
- Invention: Smartphones + the Internet
- Language: Even more direct manipulation
- HCI Goal: Enable people to access computing technology from anywhere

### Digital to Physical
Digitizing the physical movements in the real world.
- Invention: Sensors + Big Data
- Language: Natural human contact and movement
- HCI Goal: Bring the digital world into a physical space

### The Assistant 
Apps use natural language to assist people's needs.
The assistants can have a personality. How much can machines mimic humanity? What does it mean to be human? 
Is consciousness valuable? What kind of relationships do we want to have with machines?
- Invention: AI + NLP
- Language: Natural human speech and text
- HCI Goal: Get a machine to think and act like a human

### Beyond Humans 
Machine capabilities surpass those of humans. The goal of HCI is "to be __removed__." 
There will be so much automation that there will be no need of human input.
How much do you value a human's life? Moral dilemmas need to be addressed.
- Invention: Sensors + AI + Computer vision
- Language: (NONE)
- HCI Goal: Replace the need for humans

### More than Reality
Still in infancy, AR and VR are growing to be the new platform in computing. The goal is to connect the physical world and the digital world, or move them beyond.
The key will be in "__mediation__." 
- Invention: Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality
- Language: (VARIES)
- HCI Goal: Connect the physcial world with the virtual world, Bring humans into a virtual world. 

### Into the Sci-Fi
Still now, all interactions between humans and computers are still much in direct manipulation. Can our thoughts send a message to the computer instead?
Superhumans may be available thanks to an amalgam of technologies. Would there be a superhuman _caste_?
- Invention: Brain-computer interfaces
- Language: Human thought
- HCI Goal: Augment humans

### Inventions and Unintended Consequences
- Will we have a distopia? In the words of Irene Au, "The future language of HCI needs to be informed by ethics, politics, art, and an understanding of human consciousness."
- Who decides? We are all stakeholders. We all play a role in shaping our relationship with technologies. We can help decide what's worth using and our time.
