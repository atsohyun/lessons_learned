Background
--
- Data is the critical component in building AI systems

Problem
--
- Data work is often under-valued in AI development, which creates problems such as :
  - AI models are increasinlgy applied in high-stakes domains, e.g. maternal health, road safety, and climate change
  - Poor data quality can have an impact in high-stakes domains, e.g. IBM's poor data practices in cancer treatment AI
  - High-stakes domains often involve low-resource contexts, e.g. rural areas lacking sufficient infrastructure to gather data
  - High-stakes AI often involve challenges in collaborative efforts from more than one discipline, e.g. AI and idabetic retinopathy, etc. 

Solution
--
- Why HCI:
  - "HCI and CSCW scholarship have long examined the practices of collaboration, problem formulation, and sensemaking, by humans behind the datasets, including data collectors and scientists, and are designing computational artefacts for dataset development." 
- Empirically examine data practices and challenges of high-stakes AI practitioners impacting vulnerable groups 

Methods
--
- Qualitative stuyd on practices and structural factors among 53 AI practitioners in India, the US, and East and West African countries 
  - high-stakes AI domains including: landslide detection, suicide prevention, and cancer detection
  - aim is to understand how practitioners conceptualize and navigate the end-to-end AI data life cycles

Findings
--
- **Data Cascades** : compounding events causing negative, downstream effects from data issues, resulting in technical debt over time
  - 92% of AI practitioners reported experiencing one or more issues related to DC
  - 45.3% reported two or more cascdes in a given project
  - often caused by applying conventional AI practices that undervalue data quality 
- "The prevalence of data cascades point to the contours of a larger problem: residual conventions and perceptions in AI/ML drawn from worlds of 'big data' - of abundant, expendable digital resources and worlds in which one user has one account; of model valourization; of moving fast to proof-of-concept; and of viewing data as grunt work in ML workflows."

Contributions
--
- Highlights the need for **data excellence** in building AI systems, a shift to proactively considering care, sanctity, and diligence in data as valuable contributions in the AI ecosystem 
  - Concept and documentation of data cascades, their characteristics, and impact on the end-to-end AI lifecycle, drawn from an empirical study of data practices of international AI practitioners in high-stakes domains
  - Empirically drawn awareness for the need of urgent structural change in AI research and development to incentivize care in data excellence, through our case study of high-stakes AI
  - Implications for HCI: an under-explored but significant new research path for the field in creating interfaces, processes, and policy for data excellence in AI
