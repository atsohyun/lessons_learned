### Characteristics of User Satisfaction
- mastery of the system;
- competence in the performance of their task;
- ease in learning the system originally and in assimilating advanced features;
- confidence in their capacity to retain mastery over time;
- enjoyment in using the system;
- eagerness to show if off to novices; and
- desire to explore more powerful aspects of the system
&#8594; __Direct Manipulation Systems__

### Explanations of Direct Manipulation
- Design Approach:
  - Don Hatfield (IBM), "What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG)" 
  - Ted Nelson, "virtuality" - a representation of reality that can be manipulated
  - Rutkowski, "principle of transparency" - the user is able to apply intellect directly to the task
- Problem-solving and Learning Approach
  - Suitable representations of problems are crucial to solution finding and to learning
  - In this environment, users can receive rapid feedback about their programs, can easily determine wFhat has happened, can quickly spot and repair errors, and can experience creative satisfaction

### Problems with Direct Manipulation
- Graphic and spatial representations are helpful, but when ideas get complex and additional rules need to be applied, they may not help with performance
- Users must learn the components of graphic representations
- Graphic representations themselves can be misleading
- Graphic representations can take up extra display space
  - Choosing the right representation is **not** easy; users may not share the designer's metaphor, analogy, or conceptual model

### Integrated Portrait of Direct Manipulation
- Continuous representation of the object of interest;
- Physical actions (movement and selection by mouse, joystick, touch screen, etc.) or labeled button presses instead of complex syntax;
- Rapid, incremental, reversible operations whose impact on the object of interest is immediately visible; and
- Layered or spiral approach to learning that permits usage with minimal knowledge. Novices can learn a modest and useful set of commands, which they can exercise till they become an "expert" at level I of the system.

### The Cognitive (Syntactic/Semantic) Model of User Behavior 
- Syntactic Knowledge: 
  - the details of command syntax
  - easily forgotten if less frequently used
- Semantic Knowledge:
  - concepts or functionality
  - acquired through general explanation, anaology, or example - therefore stable in memory

### Implications of Syntactic/Semantic Model
- Novices begin with a close link between syntax and semantics; they focus on remembering the command functions 
- As users gain experience, thev increasingly think in higher lexel semantic terwns,xhich are freer from the syntactic detail and more svstem independent
- The syntactic/semantic model suggests that traininee maniuals should be w ritten f'rom the more familiar, high-level, problem domain viewpoint
- The syntactic/semantic model prosides a simple model of human cognitive activity. It must be refined and cxtended to enlhance its explanatory and predictive power

### Potential Applications of Direct Manipulation
- The trick in creating a direct manipulation system is **to come up with an appropriate representation or model of reality**
- Interactive systems that display a representation of the object of interest and permit rapid, incremental, reversible operations through physical actions rather than command syntax are attracting enthusiastic users.
  - Immediate visibility of the results of operations and a layered or spiral approach to learning contribute to the attraction
