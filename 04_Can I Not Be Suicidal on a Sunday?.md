Background
-- 
- Mental health helplines are a simple and pervasive form of technology-mediated mental helath support system 
  - Callers use helplines not only to seek mental health support but also to ask for care related information or replace formal care
  - Can potentially be the first step on a pathway to further psychiatric care
- Goldberg and Huxley's "pathway to psychiatric care"
  - patyways available to individuals in distress are influenced by societal factors, including marginalization, stigma, and oppression

Problem
--
- While "point of first contact" with care can influence an individual's later engagements with care, little work has been conducted 
  - Limited research in terms of __technology-mediated__ points of access to care, and how they influence an individual's care experience

Research Question
--
- How does the design of the Indian mental health helpline system interact with societal factors to marginalize callers' individual, identity-based needs?

Solution
--
- Interview 18 stakeholders and analyze the findings in Sen's realzation-focused justice framework 

Theoretical Background
--
- Goldberg and Huxley's "Pathways to Psychiatric Care"
  - one may escalate the level of care received based on progressive referrals from health professionals 
  - can be affected by different cultural notions and norms 
  - can be affected by power differentials 
  - can be affected by systemic and institutional biases 
  - pathways can also be non-linear and bidirectional 

- Technology-Mediated Points of Access to Care 
  - points of first contact can influence people's engagements with mental health care
  - first points of contact can be technologically mediated, e.g. through Internet searches 
  - limited research address the problem of the design of a particular TMMHS system about its influence on later engagements with care 

- Realization-Focused Justice in Providing Care
  - questions around how sociotechnical systems can support or exacerbate individual needs have been a growing field of study in HCI
  - existing notions of social justice only function as a mechanism for thinking about how power and privilege shape our interactions with each other, with institutions, and with technology
  - Constanza-Chock: "centering the voices of those who are directly impacted by the outcomes of the design process" 
    - urges to look directly at whether these resources and systems do justice to people's individual needs 
  - Rawls' distributive justice: justice achieved via (ideal) institutions, thus overlook community and relational forms of oppression and justice
  - Sen's __niti__ and __nyaya__: institutional justice vs realization-focused justice 
    - __niti__ : the procedural and legal ways that justice may be enacted 
    - __nyaya__ : the world that actually emerges, not just the institutions or rules we happen to have 
  - to promote Sen's realization-focused justice: the creation of institutions that support the practice of an ideal justice + specific attention and action around the removal of injustices from the perspective of those whose needs are not met 
  
Method 
--
- Semi-structured interviews with 18 participants, with diverse backgrounds and areas of India
  - recruited via purposive and snowball sampling, online depression support groups on Whatsapp and Telegram, Twitter
  - conducted until researchers reached a point of satutration 
- Inductive and iterative analyses

Findings
--
- Finding Helplines 
  - struck with intense distress or suicidal ideation, looking for resources to relieve that distress
  - motivated to call helplines with a "trust factor" - identity-based services 
  - privacy policies are rarely trusted
- Using Helplines
  - helplines not picking up 
  - casting a wide net to increase chances to connect 
  - one-time interaction with a volunteer
  - different service quality, different expectations
- Pathways to Future Care
  - helplines are stopgap measures
  - identifiable services are not attractive 
  - societal changes are necessary to effecitvely make helplines affirmative for all 

Discussion
--
- A key gap exists between how care was intended by those who support helplines, and how that same care was experienced in practice by those who needed it most 
  - the institutional promise of a quickly accessible active listener was rarely successfully realized for participants (= gap between __niti__ and __nyaya__)
- Barriers rooted in the design of the helpline system limited their ability to engage with the resource, further influencing their future interactions with other forms of care
  - these intersections between individual needs, societal factors, and the design of the system make clear the need for researchers to deeply consider how structural factors create hurdles along an individual's pathway to care

Takeaways
--
- Drawing upon a theoretical (sociological) framework to discuss a common problem in HCI: designing technology for the people 
- A key qualitative study paper 
- Beautifully written
