- [Takeaway](#takeaway)

Background
--
- Conversational agents are growing in popularity

Problem
--
- Little consensus to best practice for the design of CA

Solution
--
- Develop a comprehensive set of heuristics for CA-based interactions

Method
--
- Employ a four-phased design process to expand on Nielsen's heuristics
	- Heuristic Generation: Develop a set of heuristics based on prior research
	- Expert Review: Collect expert feedback
	- Validation Through Heuristic Evaluation: Evaluate on Amazon Echo and online chatbot
	- Validation on Revised Heuristics: Validated heuristics compared to Nielsen's

Takeaway
--
- Can be an important reference for future work on CA design, especially on addressing/discussing usability issues
